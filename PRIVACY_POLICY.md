# Privacy Policy for Deep Flow

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

Thank you for using Deep Flow. This privacy policy explains what information the extension collects and how it is used.

## Data Collection and Usage

Deep Flow is designed with your privacy in mind. The extension's core functionality is to provide a focus timer and track your session history.

*   **No Personal Data is Collected:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.
*   **Local Storage Only:** All data created by you, including your task names, session history, and any notes or insights you add, is stored exclusively on your local device using the browser's built-in storage.
*   **No Server Communication:** This data is never sent to any external server or third party. It remains within your browser and is under your control. You can clear this data at any time by deleting sessions from the history page or by uninstalling the extension.

## Permissions

Deep Flow requests the minimum permissions required for it to function:

*   `storage`: To save your session history and settings locally on your device.
*   `sidePanel`: To display the extension's user interface in the browser's side panel.
*   `alarms`: To manage the timer functionality accurately in the background.
*   `notifications`: To inform you when a focus session has been completed.
*   `offscreen`: To play audio sounds for the timer alarm and completion chimes.
